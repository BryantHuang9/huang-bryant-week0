It's interesting how the author framed hackers. He equates them to artists, who use code rather than a canvas as a way to express themselves. Designing beautiful software is definitely a cool part of computer science, and I think there should be more roles in universities and companies where hackers are given the time, resources, and money to just create. For instance, unix was made at Bell Labs when two scientists wanted to tinker with an old computer; they ended up making a whole operating system that was unlike anything seen before. If any employee or researcher suddenly has an idea, their employer should let them drop their current tasks and focus entirely on developing the idea. Ideas are fleeting moments, and can't become reality unless invested in. For all the ideas that may fail, one may be revolutionary and transform our society in unimaginable ways.
