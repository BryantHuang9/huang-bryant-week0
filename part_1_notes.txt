My neofetch, which I ran locally on my WSL, has a few differences from yours. By the way, I did this because although I installed neofetch on clear, it would not run for some reason. Anyways, the left picture probably represents the operating system, since yours has a mac logo and mine has a WSL logo if I'm not mistaken. I also have less information displayed than yours on the right, and there is less variety in color compared to yours. I assume the pallete in the bottom of your screen allows you to adjust the colors, which I do not have. 
With regards to my clear, it's a fresh entrance for me so I don't have any files to my account besides neofetch. It's also cool to see that I can look at all the users in clear by doing cd .. after entering the default repository after successfully sshing in.
