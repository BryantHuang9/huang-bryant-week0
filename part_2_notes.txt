The demonstration of comparing a sentence to words in a dictionary to find misspelled words was very interesting to me. It's cool how unix serves as a pipeline that just lets the user use a bunch of preexisting programs to perform a task, without writing much code themselves. This really does streamline tasks and make it easier for people with less technical knowledge to make use of these powerful tools.
